## Deliverables

#### Students... deliverables will be checked Monday. We will be looking for all of the things taught this week (Except Promises, but you should totally try)

- A working MEN stack application.
- Folder structure to define your applcation achitecture (We've been doing this for a bit now, think Model + Controllers)
- Server side should be deployed and running on `heroku`
- Client side should be deployed and running on `GH-Pages`

## Resources:
This one you will need for your node app... It has to be set to allow cross origin responding. For now, set: [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#The_HTTP_response_headers) to `*`
